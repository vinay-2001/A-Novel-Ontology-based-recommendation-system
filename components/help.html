        <h1>Soil Texture</h1>
        <p>Soil texture refers to the proportions of sand (2.0 – 0.05 mm in diameter), silt (0.05 – 0.002 mm), and clay (less than 0.002 mm) in the soil. Loam is soil that has equal parts sand, silt and clay. A soil texture triangle is determined by the proportion of sand, silt and clay. Below is a Soil Texture Triangle.</p>

        <h1>Soil Nutrients</h1>
        <p>Soil is a major source of nutrients for plant growth. Soil nutrients refer to nutrients that can be directly or indirectly absorbed and utilized by plants. It is the material basis of soil fertility and one of the important indicators for evaluating soil quality. Nutrients supplied by the soil are called mineral nutrients. The non-mineral nutrients such as carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) come from air and water during photosynthesis. Soil mineral nutrients are separated into two groups the macro and micronutrients. The macro nutrients are further broken down into two groups the primary and the intermediate nutrients. The primary nutrients are required by plants in relatively large proportions. These are the most famous; the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) commonly referred to as NPK. The intermediate nutrients are required by plants in medium quantities, these are calcium (Ca) magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S). The micronutrients are required in relatively small proportions. They include the iron (Fe), boron (B), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn).</p>

                <p>Phosphorus helps transfer energy from sunlight to plants, stimulates early root and plant growth, and hastens maturity. The primary forms of phosphorus uptake by plant roots are H2PO4– (Dihydrogen phosphate) and HPO42- (hydrogen phosphate). There are various forms of organic phosphorus taken up in fewer quantities. Molecules like ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and others utilize phosphorus. ATP and phosphorus are critical molecules in photosynthetic processes. Genetic materials like DNA and RNA also contain phosphorus. Obviously, both of these are critical for plant growth. The leaf sample on the left indicates the deficiency of phosporous in plants.</p>

                <p>Potassium increases vigour and disease resistance of plants, helps form and move starches, sugars and oils in plants, and can improve fruit quality. The major role of potassium is to regulate opening and closing of stomata which helps to maintain water and carbon dioxide uptake. It has an important role in the activation of many growth related enzymes in plants. It also provides resistance against the pest, diseases and stresses.

                <p>Magnesium is a key component of chlorophyll, the green colouring material of plants, and is vital for photosynthesis (the conversion of the sun's energy to food for the plant). Deficiencies occur mainly on sandy acid soils in high rainfall areas, especially if used for intensive horticulture or dairying. Heavy applications of potassium in fertilisers can also produce magnesium deficiency, so banana growers need to watch magnesium levels because bananas are big potassium users.

        <h2>Other Soil Parameters</h2>
        <h3>Soil pH</h3>
        <p>Soil pH (also known as soil reaction) is a 14-unit scale (0-14) which measures the relative acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of a soil. A pH of 7 is the neutral mark. All values below 7 are considered acidic or sour soil. All values above 7 are considered alkaline or sweet soil. The optimal pH range of soil is 5.5 to 7.</p>
        <img src="./images/SoilpH.png" alt="" style="margin-left: 500px;" alt="" width="400" height="400">
        <h3>Soil Salinity</h3>
        <p>Soil salinity is a measure of the concentration of all the soluble salts in soil water, and is usually expressed as electrical conductivity (EC). The major soluble mineral salts are the cations like sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+) and the anions like chloride (Cl−), sulfate (SO4 2−), bicarbonate (HCO3 −), carbonate (CO3 2−), and nitrate (NO3 −).</p>

        <h3>Soil Electrical Conductivity (EC)</h3>
        <p>Soil EC refers to the ability of soil to conduct an electrical current and is influenced by the presence of ions in the soil solution. These ions can conduct electricity, and their concentration affects the overall conductivity of the soil. The most common cation ions found in soil are Calcium (Ca+), Magnesium (Mg+), Potassium (K+), Ammonium (NH4+) and Hydrogen (H+)</p>

        <h3>Soil Organic Matter</h3>
        <p>Soil organic matter (SOM) typically comprises just 1%–5% of the soil mass that plays a critical role in maintaining the soil health. It is the largest terrestrial reservoir of organic C and also a large storehouse for all essential nutrients. </p>
